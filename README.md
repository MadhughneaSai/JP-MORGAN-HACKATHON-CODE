# React Frontend Project

## Overview
This project is a modern React-based single-page application that leverages several popular libraries and tools for building a responsive, dynamic, and interactive UI, with Firebase providing backend capabilities. It includes routing, layout management, and various utility libraries for enhanced functionality.

## Features
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React and Bootstrap for mobile-friendly design.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Uses React Router DOM for efficient navigation.
- **Firebase Integration:** Handles authentication or database services in a serverless manner.
- **EmailJS Support:** Facilitates sending emails directly from the frontend.
- **Advanced Layout Management:** Utilizes Isotope for filtering and grid layouts.
- **Styling Flexibility:** Uses Styled Components for localized and maintainable CSS.
- **Icon Integration:** Incorporates FontAwesome icons (SVG and regular sets).
- **Testing Setup:** Comes with React Testing Library for unit and snapshot tests.
